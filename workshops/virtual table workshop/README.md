# Virtual Table Workshop

## Introduction
Integrating w/ Dataverse enables Business Central to interact w/ other apps in its ecosystem, see [a review of Business Central & Dataverse integration](https://github.com/microsoft/d365bcdv/blob/main/Review%20of%20Business%20Central%20and%20Dataverse%20integration.pdf).  There are four types of complementary app/system interactions: Data Sync that replicates data between Business Central & Dataverse, virtual tables on Dataverse via Business Central API for (**C**reate/**R**ead/**U**pdate/**D**elete) operations, data change (**CUD**) events, and business events.

This workshop focuses on those interactions enabled by our virtual table plugin thatâ€™s installed on Dataverse: virtual tables, data (CUD) events, and business events.
